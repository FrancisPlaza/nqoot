nQoot: Crowd-approved comment system
========================

###What is nQoot?

nQoot is a Quora-like knowledge website where users can add questions as well as respond to existing ones.

###How does it work?

In nQoot, users can register by logging in with their Facebook accounts. All registered users have the ability to post questions as well as answer existing ones. Users can also upvote answers to questions. Answers with the highest number of votes in a specific question will be displayed on top of other answers. Staff (privileged users) can endorse answers. All endorsed answers will appear with a green background. Endorsement of answers will not affect the vote-based display sequence of answers.

###Features in the future

In the next iteration of the application, features such as adding comments to answers, deleting a comment, and many others will be implemented. As of now, the application is in the MVP stage to show the basic functionality of the app.

###How to become staff?

For testing purposes, it's easy to become staff: Just go to the URL http://nqoot.francis.ph/add/staff/[FACEBOOK_ID] where FACEBOOK_ID is the ID number of your Facebook account. **Take note, the ID number is all digits and it is not equal to your Facebook username.**
